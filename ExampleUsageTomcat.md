#Using libsndfile in a webapp

## Introduction ##
The following example shows how to use a libsndfile java wrapper (generated by SWIG) that references DLLs within a web container like Tomcat.


## Starting Point ##
What do I need to get started?

  1. libsndfile-1.dll
    * libsndfile DLL included within a [libsndfile installer](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)
  1. libsndfile\_wrap.dll
    * Included in [libsndfile java wrapper](http://code.google.com/p/libsndfile-java/)
  1. libsndfile-wrapper-0.1.jar
    * Included in [libsndfile java wrapper project](http://code.google.com/p/libsndfile-java/)
  1. dll-bootstrapper-0.1.jar
    * Included in [static dll bootstrapper project](http://code.google.com/p/static-dll-bootstrapper)
  1. Tomcat 7 (in this example)
  1. Java 1.7 (in this example)


## Configuration ##
  1. libsndfile-1.dll -> JAVA\_HOME/bin/libsndfile-1.dll
    * **WARNING**: Ensure this DLL is not found within your webapp
  1. libsndfile\_wrap.dll -> JAVA\_HOME/bin/libsndfile-1.dll
    * **WARNING**: Ensure this DLL is not found within your webapp
  1. libsndfile-wrapper-0.1.jar -> TOMCAT\_HOME/lib/libsndfile-wrapper-0.1.jar
    * **WARNING**: Be sure this JAR is not included in your WEBAPP or you will get an UnsatisfiedLinkError because it will be loaded in the Webapps ClassLoader
  1. dll-bootstrapper-0.1.jar -> TOMCAT\_HOME/lib/dll-bootstrapper-0.1.jar
    * **WARNING**: Ensure this JAR is not found within your webapp
  1. dll-bootstrapper.properties -> TOMCAT\_HOME/lib/dll-bootstrapper.properties

### Contents of dll-bootstrapper.properties ###
```
#default properties file
dll.0=libsndfile-1
dll.1=libsndfile_wrap
```


## Usage ##
Within your webapp, simply add the following line of code somewhere that is guaranteed to be loaded at least once, prior to your use of libsndfile.
```
  // force the JVM to find and load this class (but not instantiate it)
  Class.forName("msm.DLLBootstrapper");
```

That's it!


## Verification ##
An easy way to verify that this works is to instantiate a libsndfile class right after the Class.forName.

```
try {
   Class.forName("msm.DLLBootstrapper");
} catch (Exception e) {
   logger.error("   DLLBootstrapper not found, " + e.getMessage(), e);
}

try {
   // testing that the libraries are actually loaded
   SF_INFO sf = new SF_INFO();
   logger.debug("    tested libsndfile.SF_INFO - okay (2)");
} catch (UnsatisfiedLinkError ule) {
   logger.error("  failed to load libsndfile.SF_INFO libraries (2)", ule);
}
```

## Why does it work? ##
Everything required to load libsndfile exists in the TOMCAT\_HOME/lib directory, which means when they are loaded by Tomcat, they are loaded into the shared/common ClassLoader, which means they are available to all webapps ([as explained in the Tomcat documentation](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/class-loader-howto.html)).

Required DLLs exist within the JAVA\_HOME/bin directory, which is necessary if you don't want to setup a java.library.path .  I forget exactly why this works, but it does.

When Class.forName is executed, the JVM will load the DLLBootstrapper class into the shared/common ClassLoader.  The DLLBootstrapper will then load all DLLs (or libraries) referenced in it's properties file, which makes them available to all webapps running in Tomcat.

Make sense?


Awesome.
